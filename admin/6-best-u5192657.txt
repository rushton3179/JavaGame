I submit the class TextBack for assessment as my best class.

I declare that this class is entirely my own work, with the following
documented exceptions:

- It was modeled after the Caterpillar class done in lectures.

-The idea was conceived after I could not find an easy efficient way to 
	stream in graphics when they were being constantly updated.
