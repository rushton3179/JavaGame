I declare that the work I have submitted for Stage 3 of this
assignment and all stages before it is entirely my own work, with the
following documented exceptions:

I used Oracle documentation to find out the available javafx functions.
The Oracle tutorial from the following web page was used to learn from 
and broaden my understanding of animation in javafx 
http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/animations/basics.htm#CJAFADFJ

Comp1510 lecture code and lecture notes on javafx, specifically on key event
handlers, were reviewed as examples of javafx syntax.
