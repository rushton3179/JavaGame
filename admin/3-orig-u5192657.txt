I declare that the work I have submitted for Stage 3 of this
assignment and all stages before it is entirely my own work, with the
following documented exceptions:

- This code for Score was developed completely by myself. The scoring pattern is based
	off the scoring pattern of Scrabble but with length bonuses added.
	
- Implementing this code into the graphical game was done with Robert Blaszkowski as he built the 
	code for the currently implemented graphical display.
