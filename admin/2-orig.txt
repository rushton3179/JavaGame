We declare that the work we have submitted for Stage 2 of this
assignment and all stages before it is entirely our own work, with the
following documented exceptions:

-(Choice) To read a line of text into an array, we used 
	www.stackoverflow.com/question/2977075/java-how-to-read-a-txt-file-into-an-array-of-strings 
	and the Oracle documentation as a reference point to start.

-(Compare) To find the file without having to include the full directory we used 
	www.stackoverflow.com/question/2792870/java-cant-find-file-when-running-through-eclipse 
	and then wrote our own version of the code.

-(Modbucket) to understand thread syntax we looked at the following examples 
	www.stackoverflow.com/questions/12191029/running-two-independent-tasks-simultaneously-using-threads 
	and http://enos.itcollege.ee/~jpoial/docs/tutorial/essential/threads/timer.html
