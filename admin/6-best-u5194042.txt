I submit the class <StartMenu> for assessment as my best class.

I declare that this class is entirely my own work, with the following
documented exceptions:

- This was used to figure out buttons - http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/ui_controls/button.htm
- This was used for mouse events - http://java-buddy.blogspot.com.au/2012/03/detect-mouse-event.html
